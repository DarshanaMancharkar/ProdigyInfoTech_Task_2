# ProdigyInfoTech_Task_2

This project is part of Prodigy Infotech’s Data Science Internship – Task 2. The objective of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize both continuous and categorical variables to identify patterns and relationships. For this task, a real-world dataset was used to analyze trends and distributions across relevant features.

🎯 Objective  
• Load and preprocess a real-world dataset  
• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
• Visualize data distribution using:  
  o Histogram (continuous variable)  
  o Bar chart (categorical comparison)  
• Understand trends and relationships between variables
